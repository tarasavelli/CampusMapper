Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Intersection.java: This class acts as a vertex for Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm. It represents all of the attributes of an intersection such as the intersection name, a list of the point of interests, and a list of direct connections that this intersection connects to and ways to modify and get some of that data.

Connection.java: This class acts similar to an edge for Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm. It represents all of the other intersections that a particular intersection directly connects to and has methods on obtaining that data.

DataWrangler.java: The sole purpose of this class is to read from the two data files required to implement our project task, and return an array list of that data to the backend.

TestDataWrangler.java: This class tests all of the classes mentioned above.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
- Co-created the data wrangler file with the other data wrangler. Since we could not find a data file online that suited our project idea, we had to create the data from scratch.
